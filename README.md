# Threat Detection and Security Operations with AWS Cloud and ELK-Stack


## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of hands-on labs demonstrating expertise in cloud deployment, cybersecurity monitoring, and threat detection. The project leverages a SIEM solution built with the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana), and Grafana on Amazon Web Servicve (AWS Cloud) to centralize, analyze, and visualize security data. Additionally, it integrates Suricata IDS/IPS rules to intercept and block malware traffic, showcasing both detection and prevention capabilities in a simulated cloud environment. The labs simulate real-world security environments where detection, logging, and monitoring are critical.  


---

## Key Objectives

- Deploy and configure **AWS EC2 instances** as test environments.  
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring with the **ELK Stack**.  
- Capture network activity and detect anomalies using **Zeek**.  
- Conduct real-time intrusion detection with **Suricata IDS**.  
- Visualize alerts and logs using **Grafana dashboards**.  
- Integrate **Filebeat** to ship logs efficiently from multiple sources.  

---

## Lab Walkthrough

### 1. AWS EC2 Deployment
EC2 instances were deployed as isolated test environments to simulate a real-world cloud infrastructure.  
I configured networking, security groups, and instance settings to ensure safe and controlled environments for security testing.  
This demonstrates **cloud administration skills** and the ability to create **scalable, secure environments** for cybersecurity operations.

---

### 2. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
The ELK Stack was implemented to **centralize logs from multiple sources**.  
- **Elasticsearch** stores and indexes data efficiently.  
- **Logstash** processes and normalizes logs.  
- **Kibana** provides interactive dashboards for analysis.  

This setup shows my ability to implement **robust monitoring solutions** and manage **large-scale log data** for actionable insights.

---

### 3. Zeek (Network Traffic Analysis)
Zeek was used to **capture and analyze network traffic in real time**.  
By detecting anomalies and suspicious activities, I could identify potential threats and generate detailed logs for further analysis.  

This highlights skills in **network monitoring, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence**.

---

### 4. Suricata IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
Suricata was configured for real-time threat detection.
It analyzes traffic against rule sets to detect intrusions, malware, or suspicious activity.

To enhance visibility and analyst efficiency, EveBox was integrated as a GUI for Suricataâ€™s eve.json logs. Suricata generates alerts and event logs in JSON format (eve.json), which EveBox processes and displays in a clean, web-based dashboard.

EveBox provides features such as search, filtering, drill-down investigation, and case management (e.g., escalating or archiving alerts). It also supports Elasticsearch as a backend, enabling scalable event storage and querying.

---

### 5. Grafana Dashboards
Grafana was used to **visualize logs, alerts, and system metrics** from ELK, Zeek, and Suricata.  
Interactive dashboards were created for trend analysis and incident monitoring, showing my ability to **communicate complex security data in an accessible, visual format**.

---

### 6. Filebeat Integration
Filebeat was configured to **efficiently ship logs from multiple sources to Elasticsearch**.  
This ensures a reliable and scalable log collection pipeline, demonstrating expertise in **data ingestion, automation, and centralized monitoring** for security operations.
